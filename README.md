# TOSH

TOSH (Thoth Official SHell) is a shell designed to operate on POSIX systems. It is simple and lightweight, providing few features beyond the basic functionality you would expect from a shell.

## Syntax

```

# Double quotes are counted as a string
echo "Hello, there!"

# Brackets are evaluated as a command expansion, unless prefixed by a '\'
echo "My name is {whoami}, not \{whoami\}"

```
